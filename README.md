# Dotify - Homework 5 – WorkManager & Notifications

## Sailesh Sivakumar INFO 448 SP 21

The app is a proof of concept of a music player based on username wherein usernames can be changed and the play, previous, and next buttons display messages regarding song queue and makes use of fragments to pass persistent data through multiple screens. Latest: display actionable notifications regarding songs.

Extra Credit attempted:
1. FOR DOTIFY project ONLY: In requirement 2.b.v.2, tapping the notification should launch PlayerActivity that passes the song data to the activity to show the song in the player (+1)
2. In a separate function, create another separate alternative work request that runs every 2 days when the device’s battery is not too low and is connected to a network. For credit, you just need the request code in your WorkManager class, no other code is required. (+.25)
